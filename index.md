## Predicting the 2020 Election (Rick Brown)


### Week of 9/6: Past Insights

Analyzing swing states has long been a hallmark American election forecasts, and 2020 looks to be no different. This time there is much buzz about a wider field of states being in play than ever before: staples like Iowa, Ohio, Florida, and New Hampshire are frequently mentioned, but this time so are more unusual choices like Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Texas. Perhaps this is because of the chaos caused by the coronavirus epidemic, or perhaps due to the drama of the Trump administration. Regardless of why, are this many states actually in play for Joe Biden, and if so, is this as unusual as it's made out to be?

Well, let's first look at a summary of each party's statewide margin of victory for presidential elections since 1980:

Even since 1980 candidates seem to be running closer races in most states; with the exception of Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming, most states seem to very widely in intensity from strongly Republican to more moderately so (or perhaps even Democratic). This trend bodes well for Biden. But given the many changes that have happened since 1980, like the downfall of the USSR and creation of Google, more relevant insights for the 2020 election will likely come from the past two decades.

In this shorter timespan it still seems evident that many states are not solidly Republican or Democratic. Democratic strongholds in the Northeast and Rust Belt region appear to be increasingly less Democratic while Republican strength in the Southeast is diminishing. (There are exceptions, of course - New York, Kentucky, and West Virginia vote increasingly for a particular party within this time frame.) The Southwest and Texas look very much in flux.
